**Customer Segmentation Project Report - Fashion Trends**

**Step 1: Data Loading and Cleaning**

- Loaded the customer dataset from an Excel file.

- Initially found data combined in one column; cleaned and split into appropriate columns.

- Removed duplicate header row and converted relevant columns to proper data types.

**Step 2: Data Exploration**

- Explored the dataset to understand feature types, distributions, and completeness.

- Identified numerical features like age and last purchase year, and categorical features such as gender, purchase and browsing behavior, country, and last purchased item.

- Verified minimal missing values after cleaning.

**Step 3: Data Preprocessing**

- Handled missing data by excluding incomplete records.

- Standardized numerical features to have a mean of zero and unit variance.

- Encoded categorical features to prepare for clustering.

**Step 4: Clustering Algorithm Selection**

- Selected K-means clustering due to its effectiveness for moderate-sized datasets and ease of interpreting clusters.

**Step 5: Clustering and Labeling**

- Applied K-means clustering to partition the customers into distinct segments.

- Labeled each customer with their respective cluster assignment for further analysis.

**Step 6: Cluster Analysis**

- Analyzed the characteristics of each cluster, including average age, gender distribution, purchase frequency, browsing habits, regional preferences, and product interests.

- Identified distinct behavioral patterns unique to each segment.

**Step 7: Actionable Recommendations**

- Proposed personalized marketing strategies tailored for each clusterâ€™s preferences and behaviors:

- Exclusive offers and content for high engagement customers.

- Discounts and easy shopping experiences for price-sensitive groups.

- Social media-focused campaigns for trend-conscious segments.

- Localized promotions for region-specific clusters.

- Emphasized strategies to improve customer engagement, satisfaction, and retention.

**Step 8: Data Visualization**

- Created visual representations of customer clusters using dimensionality reduction and scatter plots.

- Used bar charts to show cluster sizes and feature distributions.

- Visual insights enabled clear communication of segmentation results to stakeholders.
