    "# Salary Prediction\n",
    "- [The Adult Salary Prediction dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult) consists of data from the 1994 US Census and the task is to predict whether a person earns `over $50K` a year (Class 1) or `less than $50K` a year (Class 0). The columns in the dataset are as follows:\n",
